NewsNest is a responsive and dynamic web application that delivers real-time news updates using the NewsAPI. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project allows users to explore current headlines from around the world based on predefined categories like Finance, Sports and Entertainment or search custom topics using a keyword-based search bar.

The user interface is clean and mobile-friendly, featuring a responsive navigation bar with a collapsible hamburger menu on smaller screens. News articles are displayed in dynamically generated, interactive cards containing the article image, title, source, publish date, and a short description. Clicking on any card opens the full article in a new tab.

NewsNest is ideal for learning how to work with external APIs, implement dynamic DOM manipulation, and build fully responsive layouts with Flexbox and media queries.
